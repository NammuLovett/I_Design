        <h1>Extreme Ironing</h1>
        <p>
          <span>Extreme Ironing</span> <em>(also called EI)</em> is an extreme
          sport in which people take ironing boards to remote locations and iron
          items of clothing. According to the
          <a
            href="https://es-es.facebook.com/ExtremeIroningOfficial/"
            target="_blank"
            >Extreme Ironing Bureau</a
          >, <span>Extreme Ironing</span> is "the latest danger sport that
          combines the thrills of an extreme outdoor activity with the
          satisfaction of a well-pressed shirt."

          Despite how ridiculous the sport sounds, many take extreme ironing
          seriously. People even created organizations to handle various
          challenges and establish rules when participating in them. An example
          of this is the Extreme Ironing Bureau, also known as
          <strong>EIB</strong>, which promotes and regulates the sport. Thanks
          to the <strong>EIB</strong>, the rise of the sportâ€™s popularity even
          caused world championships to take place as well.

          <h2>History</h2>
          <p>
            <span class="capital">E</span> <span>xtreme Ironing</span> was
            invented in 1997 in
            <a href="https://www.visitleicester.info/" target="_blank"
              >Leicester, England</a
            >, by resident Phil Shaw in his back garden. Shaw had a number of
            chores to do, including ironing his shirts. Preferring the idea of
            an evening out rock climbing, he decided to combine the two
            activities into a new extreme sport. In June 1999, Shaw, who uses
            the nickname "Steam", embarked on an international tour to promote
            the activity. The stops included the United States, Fiji, New
            Zealand, Australia and South Africa. An encounter with German
            tourists in New Zealand led to the formation of a group called
            <a href="https://uia.org/s/or/en/1100033590" target="_blank"
              >"Extreme Ironing International"</a
            >, and the German Extreme Ironing Section or GEIS. As extreme
            ironing has branched off, the conditions can gain in extreme
            activity. For example, a branch of ironing has been developed that
            includes both bungee jumping and well-pressed clothing. Bungee
            ironing is what some would call the ultimate in the thrill of
            <span>Extreme Ironing</span>.
