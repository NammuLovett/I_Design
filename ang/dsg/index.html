                <span class="spanTitle">Count Dracula</span> is the title
                character of Bram Stoker's 1897 gothic horror novel Dracula. He
                is considered to be both the prototypical and the archetypal
                vampire in subsequent works of fiction. He is also depicted in
                the novel to be the origin of werewolf legends.Some aspects of
                the character are believed to have been inspired by the
                15th-century Wallachian Prince Vlad the Impaler.
